## Process to Extract, Transform and Load Datas (images + csv file)

### Installation
In the root of the project : 
  - in a terminal type : `python3 -m venv venv` (if you use python 2.x, type python2) and this command : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  - Finally, always in the terminal, type the command python3 main.py 

All the extracted datas will go to a folder named `data` (already created)
Just let the program runs alone and enjoy the extracted datas !
